# Wi-Fi Controlled RC Car (ESP8266 + L298N Motor Driver)

This repository contains the code and resources for a **Wi-Fi Controlled RC Car** built using the **ESP8266 microcontroller** and the **L298N motor driver**. The project was developed as part of our engineering coursework for **Project Exhibition-I**.

## Overview
The project demonstrates the integration of hardware and software to create a simple yet functional **remote-controlled car**. By utilizing the **ESP8266** for Wi-Fi connectivity and the **L298N motor driver** for motor control, we enabled seamless real-time communication between the car and the controller through a mobile app interface. The system allows for precise control of the car's movements remotely via Wi-Fi.

## Key Features:
- **Wi-Fi Control**: Enables remote control of the RC car via the **ESP8266 microcontroller**.
- **Precise Motor Control**: Utilizes the **L298N motor driver** for smooth, accurate movement of the car.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Facilitates bidirectional communication between the car and the mobile phone controller, providing real-time control and feedback.

## Future Enhancements:
- Autonomous navigation and obstacle detection
- Enhanced camera integration for live video feed
- AI features for full autonomy

## Acknowledgments:
- **Dr. Soumitra Keshari Nayak** for his invaluable mentorship and guidance throughout the project.
- **Raadhesh Bajoria** and **Manthan Sontakke** for their collaboration and support.
